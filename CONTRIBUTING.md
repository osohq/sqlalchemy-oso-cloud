# Setup

We use [Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) to manage this project.
After [installing Poetry](https://python-poetry.org/docs/#installation),
create a virtual environment and install the project's dependencies with:

```bash
poetry install --with dev
```

## Running tests

We use [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/stable/) to run tests.
To run the test suite, run:

```bash
poetry run pytest
```
